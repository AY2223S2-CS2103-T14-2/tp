### Project: PetPal

PetPal (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing pets details for staff of pet care centres and owners of pets, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

To be added soon
